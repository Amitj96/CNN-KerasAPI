# CNN-KerasAPI
• Built a five layered Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition which was trained on MNIST dataset
• Performed feature engineering and utilized Keras to build the network with Tensorflow backend
• Achieved an accuracy of 0.993 within thirty epochs which is in top twenty five percent of all Kaggle submissions
Data:
The data set consists of images.
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. 
Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. 
This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.
